ToggleClip
==========

**Toggle between X11-clipboards**

Version: 0.1

Introduction
------------
ToggleClip allows to toggle between the different X11-Clipboards, to use when
yanking something in vim.

Press <F12> to toggle between `PRIMARY`-selection (\*-resister) and
`CLIPBOARD`-selection (+-registers). The opposite selection can be used by
prefixing with `<leader>`.

Furthermore `<leader>ys` can be used to swap the contents of both selections.

If you want to display the status in for example lightline use the
function `ToggleClip#getstatus()`.
